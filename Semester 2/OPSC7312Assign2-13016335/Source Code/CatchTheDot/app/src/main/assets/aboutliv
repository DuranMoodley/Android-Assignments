There are millions of orphaned and vulnerable children in South Africa, mostly due to HIV/AIDS.
LIV focuses on a solution to this crisis.
We place these children into a family environment with a trained foster mother to love them, a school to educate them,
and where all their needs are met.
If these children are equipped with essential moral values and life skills,
they will grow up to be a generation that will influence positive change within South Africa, Africa and the world.
